ESBM (short for Entity Summarization BenchMark) is a benchmark for evaluating algorithms for entity summarization, aka entity summarizers.

Currently, three versions are available:

* [ESBM v1.0](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ESBM/tree/master/v1.0) (Last update: 2018-07-27)
* [ESBM v1.1](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ESBM/tree/master/v1.1) (Last update: 2019-03-26)
* [ESBM v1.2](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ESBM/tree/master/v1.2) (Last update: 2019-12-08)

## Submit Your Results
You are encouraged to submit the results of your entity summarizer by contacting us. We will add your results to the evaluation results tables. Your submission should contain:

* <code>Output files</code>: summaries generated by your entity summarizer;
* <code>Evaluation results</code>: evaluation results outputted by our evaluator;
* <code>Notes</code>: brief description of your entity summarizer (e.g., name of the summarizer, citation information, parameter settings, version of the ESBM benchmark).
